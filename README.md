# Validation Metrics for Classifications

Created this notebook to study and develop about classification evaluation metrics. Used a daset about Lung Cancer from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/samuelotiattakorah/lung-cancer-data/data.

There are a lot evaluation metrics, it will change depending on the problem. In cancer classification we need to guarantee that we have a low rate of False Negatives, so we need to use the right metrics to check it.

The objective here is not to develop and optimize the prediction model, but to study the evaluation metrics only.
